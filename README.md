## Architecture

The plugin follows a modular architecture:

- **BlockManager**: Discovers and manages block definitions
- **CanvasManager**: Handles canvas file operations
- **UIManager**: Manages user interface and commands
- **ActionHandler**: Orchestrates block execution
- **BlockExecutor**: Handles AI API calls

## Creating Custom Blocks

You can create custom blocks by adding them to the `blocks/` directory:

1. Create a new directory: `blocks/community/my-block/`
2. Add `block.json` with block metadata and settings
3. Add `executor.js` with the execution logic
4. Reload blocks using the plugin settings

### Block Definition Example

```json
{
  "id": "community/my-block",
  "name": "My Custom Block",
  "description": "Description of what this block does",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "category": "community",
  "settings": [
    {
      "name": "mySetting",
      "description": "Description of the setting",
      "type": "text",
      "required": true,
      "default": "default value"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Executor Example

```javascript
async function execute(inputText, config) {
  const { mySetting } = config;
  
  // Construct your prompt
  const prompt = `Process this text with setting: ${mySetting}\n\nText: ${inputText}`;
  
  // Return the prompt - the BlockExecutor will handle the AI API call
  return prompt;
}

module.exports = { execute };
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No canvas file is currently open"**
   - Make sure you have a canvas file open in Obsidian
   - The plugin only works with canvas files (.canvas)

2. **"API key not configured"**
   - Add your API keys in the plugin settings
   - Make sure the keys are valid and have sufficient credits

3. **"Block execution failed"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your API keys are correct
   - Enable debug mode to see detailed error messages

4. **"No input text found"**
   - Connect text nodes to your Living Canvas block
   - Make sure the text nodes contain actual text content

5. **"Commands not visible"**
   - The Run/Configure commands always show in the palette; if nothing is selected you‚Äôll be prompted to choose a block from the current canvas.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in the plugin settings to see detailed logging in the browser console. This helps troubleshoot issues with block execution and API calls.
