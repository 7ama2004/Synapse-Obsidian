blocks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summarizer/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ block.json
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ executor.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quizzer/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ block.json
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ executor.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ community/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-custom-block/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ block.json
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ executor.js
```

#### Block Definition (`block.json`)
```json

```

#### Block Executor (`executor.js`)
```javascript
async function execute(inputText, config, apiCall) {
    const systemPrompt = config.systemPrompt || 'You are a helpful assistant.';
    const userPrompt = `Process this text: ${inputText}`;
    
    try {
        const response = await apiCall(systemPrompt, userPrompt);
        return response;
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Processing failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
